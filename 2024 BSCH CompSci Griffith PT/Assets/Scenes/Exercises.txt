Exercise 1

Show an understanding of gameobjects, Unity Physics, collisions

Exercise 2 

Create a character controller in 2D

Exercise 3

Create a level that can be moved around in, with player animations and effectors e.g. platform effectors. Use Tilemap 2D

Exercise 4

Create a Game Manager gameobject that will control score and health. 
Create a score pickup that increases the player score. Create a UI that displays the player's score and health. 
Create checkpoints for the player, and a killzone that resets the player to the last checkpoint.

HOMEWORK: Create a spike trap (or other) that damages the player -1 health Optional: add jump and fall animations to the player.

Exercise 5
Create an enemy with a finite state machine
The enemy should damage the player when touching the player, similarly to the spike trap before
The enemy should know where the player is in relation to itself, so it knows which direction to chase the player when the player is detected
BONUS: have the animations hooked up so the enemy animates correctly, AND changes direction based on which way it is moving

3D Character Controller with animations & Enemy State Machines & Patrolling

Exercise 8
